# HS Ansbach - AI-supported Innovation Management

## AI Guideline for the Course

### General rules

📌 I expect you to apply AI (LLMs, ITONICS Suite, data analysis imaging tools, project tools, etc.) in this course. <br>
📌 In fact, this is necessary for many assignments! <br>
📌 Using AI tools is a skill and you should practice it as much as possible. <br>
📌 I will introduce relevant AI tools during the classroom sessions. You are welcome to use, contribute or develop your own tools. <br>
📌 Given the availability of AI and its power, my expectations of the results are correspondingly higher. <br>

### Be aware of the limits and limitations of AI tools:

📌 If you generate prompts with minimal effort, you will get low quality results. You need to refine, test and develop your prompts together to achieve good results. This takes time and work. <br>
📌 Don't rely on what AI tells you. If you are told a number or fact, assume it is wrong unless you know the answer or can verify it with other sources. <br>
📌 You are responsible for any errors or outputs that AI tools generate for you; it works best on topics you understand! <br>
📌 Targeted and validated prompts should be shared with the course via GitHub. <br>
📌 AI is a tool, but one that you must show how to use. Please include a paragraph at the end of each assignment where AI is used, explaining what you used AI for and what prompts you used. <br>
📌 If you do not do this, you are violating the principles of academic transparency. <br>
📌 Think carefully about when this tool is useful. <br>
